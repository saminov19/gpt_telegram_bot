# Chatbot with OpenAI and Telegram Integration

This Python script demonstrates how to create a simple chatbot that integrates with the OpenAI API and Telegram messenger. The chatbot uses OpenAI's language model to generate responses to user messages on Telegram.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script in a Docker container, ensure you have the following:

1. Docker Installed: You'll need Docker installed on your system to build and run the container.

2. OpenAI API Key: You'll need an API key from OpenAI to access their language models. Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` in the Dockerfile with your actual API key.

3. Telegram Bot Token: Create a bot on Telegram and obtain a bot token. Replace `"YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_KEY"` in the Dockerfile with your bot's token.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and Python script.

3. Build the Docker container:

   ```
   docker build -t chatbot
   ```



Run the Docker container:

```
docker run chatbot
```

The Docker container will start, and your chatbot will be active, listening for messages on Telegram.

## Important Notes

Ensure you replace "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" and "YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_KEY" in the Dockerfile with your actual API keys.

This script is a basic example and can be extended to handle more complex chatbot functionalities.

Monitor the performance of your chatbot and make necessary adjustments based on your requirements.
